How to Run
---

Run `npm install` after pulling down this repo locally.

Then pull down this [JSON server repo] (https://github.com/paigen11/json_server_api) and follow the README instructions for that one.

After the server is running, you can open up the index.html file and make GETs and POSTs to your heart's content.

It doesn't get much simpler than that.
